# Movie Watchlist with OMDB API

An awesome Movie Watchlist app, which allows users to search for movies by title, see the description, rating, runtime and genre of each movie and save any movie to their watchlist. It's made as a Solo project for [Frontend Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend), with asynchronous JS and [Open Movie Database API](http://www.omdbapi.com/), which enables searching through the movie database by movie title.
